# Backend
The backend of this project is built with the following technologies:

Node.js: a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
Express: a fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js
CORS: a Node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options
JWT: a Node.js library for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens
Bcrypt: a Node.js library for hashing passwords
MongoDB: a NoSQL database used to store user and goal data
The backend also has a user model and a goal model. The user model stores data such as a user's name, email, and hashed password. The goal model stores data such as a goal's title, description, and completion status.
